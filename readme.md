The code generates a demographic based isocline using juvenile growth and survival rates from a previously published population model for the Florida Apple Snail (FAS; recoded for use in R using the appendix of Darby et al., 2015). It also takes survial and growth data measured in the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment and the Waterconservation Area 3A of the Everglades during the dry and wet season and plots the combinations as points on the isocline state space. Plotting these points on the isocline makes the parameters interpretable in a population dynamic context. This code also contains background analyses that add further depth to the conclusion in the paper. These analyses include comparison of wet season and dry season predator communities, comparison of shell artefacts from the tethering methods used to measure survival as well as diet analyses of fish and greater sirens that help indentify which predators are most responsible for the survival patterns, calculation of growth rates from the regressions and cage experiments, and anlsyses of seasonal changes in temperature.  All data used for these analyses are housed in the "data" folder, the rscipts containing the code for the analyses are housed in the "new" subfolder within the "scripts" folder.  Some pictures were used in the creation of the figures and are housed in the "pics' folder. Most figures were generated using R and then edited in InkScape to improve appearaces for publication and can be found in the "out" folder.  The variatious drafts of the manuscript are housed in the "ms" folder.
